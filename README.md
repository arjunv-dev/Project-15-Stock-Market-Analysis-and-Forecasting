# Stock_Market_Analysis_And_Forecasting_Using_Deep_Learning
This project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically PyTorch and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) models, to analyze and forecast stock market trends.

The stock market, also known as the equity or share market, is a platform where buyers and sellers trade stocks representing ownership in businesses. These can include publicly listed securities or privately traded shares through equity crowdfunding. Most stock market investments are made via stockbrokerages and electronic trading platforms, often guided by well-defined investment strategies.

Stock price prediction has always been a challenging task for statisticians and financial experts. The goal is to identify stocks likely to increase in value for purchase and those likely to decrease for sale. Two primary approaches are used in stock market prediction:

Fundamental Analysis: Relies on evaluating a companyâ€™s financial health, market position, expenses, and growth rates.
Technical Analysis: Focuses on analyzing historical stock prices and patterns.
This project is divided into two parts:

Data Analysis: Understanding and exploring historical stock market data.
Forecasting: Predicting stock prices using advanced deep learning models.

By combining these techniques, the project aims to deliver insightful and accurate stock market predictions.

Google:
This graph represents the "High" value of Google's stock over time, along with its expanding mean and expanding standard deviation from 2006 to 2018.

High Value: The blue line indicates Google's "High" stock price, showing a significant increase over the years. From 2012 onward, the growth became more pronounced, indicating a strong upward trend.
Expanding Mean: The orange line represents the expanding mean, providing a smoothed average of the "High" values over time. It shows a consistent upward trajectory, reflecting overall growth in the stock's performance.
Expanding Standard Deviation: The green line shows the expanding standard deviation, which captures the increasing variability in the stock's "High" values. The rise indicates higher price fluctuations as the stock grew in value.
Overall, the graph highlights consistent growth in Google's stock price with increasing volatility in later years.

Trend and Seasonality:
There is a very slow increasing trend until 2012, but after 2012 there was an exponential high trend. And very high seasonality.

# Decription for User-Interface:

> run the .py as streamlit run stock_market_analysis_UI.py.
> the website would be running on the localhost and there you can upload any of the files (.csv) for the stock predictions and the model would be applied on it and lastly a Linear Regression is applied.
